# Visual Search with Cohere Embed v4 in Microsoft Foundry

Welcome to **visual-search-cohereembed4**!  
This project enables advanced image search capabilities powered by [Cohere's Embed v4]. It provides a simple, scalable system for indexing and retrieving images using multimodal AI embeddings, making it easy to find similar or relevant images in large datasets.

## 🚀 Features

- **Image Embedding:** Generate and store vector representations for your images using Cohere’s latest multimodal Embed v4 model.
- **Visual Search:** Perform similarity search to find images most similar to a query (either by example image or text description).
- **Multimodal Queries:** Search with images, text, or mixed-input queries.
- **Efficient Indexing:** Utilizes vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) for scalable and fast retrieval.
- **Easy Integration:** RESTful API and Python interfaces for seamless use in your apps or data workflows.

## 🖼️ Example Use Cases

- Reverse image search in digital asset management systems
- Content-based recommendation (find "images like this")
- Searching with descriptive text: "Show me all images of beaches at sunset"
- Visual deduplication or near-duplicate detection
